/*
 * Hack for GLFW:
 *
 * GLFW insists in not including Windows.h but defines its own symbols and
 * messes around with WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN. This leads of course to the usual
 * mess, in this case a ton of annoying warnings about redefinitions of
 * WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, and thus we came up with the following hack:
 *
 * When GLFW is compiled we include its internal.h rather than Windows.h,
 * and everything compiles without any warnings.
 *
 * This should be pretty much OK, since the first thing in the GLFW sources
 * is the inclusion of internal.h. So if we introduce a prologue header
 * that includes internal.h before doing anything else, then we shouldn't
 * have changed anything from the compiler's point of view.
