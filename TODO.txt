* Get rid of boost::noncopyable use (orly?)
* OK, so we're reintroducing the win32 namespace (as windows) again. Move already imported stuff there:
  * windows_error.hpp
* string.cpp: some stuff in there could do with some unit testing, and also optimizing (string lengths are determined multiple times)
* format_message_test.cpp: stupid test, as it obviously fails on non-english systems. Possible ways to fix: specify language ID
