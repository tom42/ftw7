* string.cpp: some stuff in there could do with some unit testing, and also optimizing (string lengths are determined multiple times)
* Improve language dependent unit tests:
  * format_message_test.cpp: stupid test, as it obviously fails on non-english systems. Possible ways to fix: specify language ID
  * module_test.cpp: stupid test, as it fails on non-english systems
